Then, run it with your target domain or a file containing a list of domains:./totalsubfinder.sh -u target.com
or./totalsubfinder.sh -f domains.txt
Options  -u <URL>       Target domain (e.g., example.com)
  -f <file>      File containing list of domains
  -w <wordlist>  Path to a custom wordlist file (default: /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt)
  -t <threads>   Number of threads (default: 40)
  -T <timeout>   Timeout in seconds (default: 30)
  -S             Enable silent mode (suppress tool output to console)
  -j             Generate JSON report
  -o <dir>       Specify output directory
  -h             Display this help message
After running the script, an interactive menu will appear, allowing you to select and configure specific tools, including Nmap scan types (light/deep) and Amass options (passive/brute/active).Usage Example./totalsubfinder.sh -f domains.txt -j -o scans/
This command will scan domains from domains.txt, generate a JSON report, and save all output files in the scans/ directory.📦 InstallationTo install ShadowMap and its dependencies, follow these steps:Download the scripts:Download totalsubfinder.sh and install.sh to your local machine.Make the installer executable:chmod +x install.sh
Run the installer:sudo ./install.sh
The installer will check for required tools (ffuf, gobuster, subfinder, amass, httpx, waybackurls, katana, hakrawler, paramspider, jq, curl, nmap). If any are missing, it will prompt you to install them using apt or go install/pip.Note: For Go-based tools (subfinder, httpx, waybackurls, katana, hakrawler), ensure you have Go installed. The installer will inform you if Go is missing.Configuration (Optional but Recommended):The installer will also attempt to copy amass_config.yaml and subfinder_config.yaml to their respective default configuration paths (~/.config/amass/config.yaml and ~/.config/subfinder/config.yaml). You might be prompted to overwrite existing configurations.Important: Remember to fill in your API keys in ~/.config/{amass,subfinder}/config.yaml for optimal results with tools like Amass and Subfinder that leverage external services.After successful installation, totalsubfinder.sh will be available in your system's PATH, and you can run it directly by typing totalsubfinder.sh.📁 Output StructureAll results are saved in the chosen output directory (default: current folder):all_subdomains.txt – All discovered unique subdomains from all enumeration tools.live_subdomains.txt – Only reachable (HTTP/S) subdomains identified by httpx.vhost_status_200.txt – Gobuster vhost results specifically with HTTP status 200.found_urls.txt – All URLs discovered from crawling tools (Waybackurls, Katana, Hakrawler).urls_with_params.txt – URLs containing parameters, identified by Paramspider.report.md – A comprehensive Markdown report summarizing the scan.report.json – A JSON summary of the scan results (if -j is set).totalsubfinder_error.log – A log file containing all errors encountered during tool execution for debugging.<domain>_nmap.nmap – Nmap scan results in normal format (if Nmap scan is enabled).<domain>_nmap.xml – Nmap scan results in XML format (if Nmap scan is enabled).<domain>_nmap.gnmap – Nmap scan results in Grepable format (if Nmap scan is enabled).📸 Screenshot<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Xzar-x/images/main/screenshot.png" alt="ShadowMap Screenshot" width="100%"></p>🔒 Stealth ModeShadowMap's interactive menu allows you to configure tools for stealthy scanning. By adjusting options like threads and timeouts (e.g., choosing "Deep Scan" for Nmap), you can minimize the footprint and avoid WAF detection or blockades.🧙‍♂️ Why "ShadowMap"?The name represents a "map" of subdomains and web surfaces discovered from the shadows – silently and effectively, just like a hacker should.The alias sm (though the current script is totalsubfinder.sh, the concept remains) also makes it quick and intuitive to use.🤖 AuthorCreated with 💻 and ☕ by XzarFeel free to contribute or suggest improvements!📜 LicenseMIT License🙌 Contributions WelcomeFound a bug?
